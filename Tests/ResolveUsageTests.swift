/// Regression tests for ClaudeCredentials.resolveUsage, run by
/// scripts/run-tests.sh (no XCTest — the app builds with bare swiftc, so the
/// harness does too). The runner sets CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN to a stub value
/// so the env-token path drives the injected probe deterministically on any
/// machine, with or without a real "Claude Code-credentials" keychain item.
///
/// Why the rate-limited case is locked down (issue #35): Anthropic's
/// /api/oauth/usage limiter is account-keyed and sticky once tripped
/// (anthropics/claude-code#30930). resolveUsage must short-circuit on the
/// first rate-limited probe — if a regression reintroduces the old
/// fall-through, every poll cycle re-probes and rotates the refresh-token
/// family against a throttled account. (On a dev machine with real keychain
/// creds, such a regression would also make THIS test perform one live token
/// rotation before the probe-count assertion catches it — noisy but
/// recoverable, since the rotation writeback path is exercised by the app
/// daily.)
